# LockScreenNotes
This project was derived from another one created during my B. Sc. Education at the Ruhr Universit√§t Bochum, Germany.

## Despite this, this is a fully functioning Android app.
You can download it from two sources. Either the Android Play Store, or via GitHub.

* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nilsfo.lsn&hl=en_US
* https://github.com/NilsFo/LockScreenNotes/releases

Any other source is not officially supported by me!

**Note**: Yes, this app is free and open source, and yes, you may edit and use all its contents.
But please notify me if you do so and report any imposters.

### Google Play Store entry:
With this app you can easily create notes that stick around for later!

Designed for you to be able to create and manage notes quickly without many interruptions.
Notes are supposed to be small and not kept for very long as they are supposed to be used for reflections and *'keep for later'* ideas, like grocery lists or anything that you need to be reminded of instantly.

Optimized to be quick and efficient so that you can write down your ideas and notes in less that 2 seconds and only one tap of a button!

Once created, a note will stick around and be instantly displayed on your lock screen as a notification.

Notes and the ways they are displayed are highly customization. You can decide if they are grouped together and displayed as a single notification or separate.
You can also set if they are always displayed prominently or more subtle. (depends on the type of device).

This App is free and without any ads or tracking! This will not change in the future!
There is also the *zero knowledge* method applied.
This means, I have no way of tracking you or spying on your notes.

### Permission requests explained:

* Run on startup: To display the notifications once you restart the device
* External storage: To read / write backups
